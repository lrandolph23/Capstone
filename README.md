# Elevator Pitch
My name is Lacy Randolph. I've spent the last 5 years as a cook in high volume environments being a part of teams and taking on heavy work loads. My curiosity and interest in JavaScript has brought me to the IT field. I'm currently attending Savvy Coders Full Stack Web Development bootcamp which facilitates a scrum environment running in two week sprints. I hope to dive deep into backend development and understand more about software engineering.
# Intro Speech
My name is Lacy Randolph. In my hometown of Cape Girardeau, Missouri 6 years before Roswell, New Mexico there was a UFO crash in a corn field. Which fueled the flame of interest I've held for aliens and supernatural my whole life. I wanted to create a safe place for people with experiences to share their stories. For anyone interested in weather versus alien activity I've added some fun space weather API's from NASA. I'd like to improve my website after Savvy Coders to include accounts if someone wants to keep track of their submissions but I want to keep an annonymous option as well.
# Savvy Coders Project Boilerplate Starter Kit

## Overview


This template repository contains several opinionated, 'starter' files and settings to help Savvy Coder students focus more time and energy on learning how to code and/or craft 'business logic' for projects and less time on configurations.

In addition to a '.gitignore' and some VS Code specific extensions and settings, it includes the 'recommended' settings for:

1. [ESLint](eslint.org)
2. [Stylelint](stylelint.io)
3. [Prettier](prettier.io)

## Get Started

**First and foremost,** make sure that your local machine is set up with all of the 'dev environment tooling' as per the instructions in the curriculum.

Well, after establishing your directory structure on your local machine, (e.g. '~/Code/SavvyCoders'), clone the Savvy Starter Repo - essentially, there should be a button that says **Use this template.**

> [Read more about using templates on GitHub here...](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

Once this repo has been created on your GitHub, you can click on the button to 'clone' it as usual.

Once it's `clone`d to your local machine, `cd` into the directory and **be sure to do:** `npm i` to get all of the dependencies installed. If you see any _errors_ (warnings are OK) on Windows, you may have to do `npm install`.

Now, enter `code .` to open this project in VS Code, and look for a prompt to 'install some extensions' once inside VS Code (in the bottom `right` of your screen). You should install these.

In your repo, feel free to update this README and make any other initial changes to files, etc. Then go ahead and do your usual `git` steps -- add, commit, and push.

**Note:** This is a template repository, no need to 'fork it.
